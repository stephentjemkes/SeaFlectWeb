# Diagnostic analysis of Aeolus return signal 

## Introduction

The *SeaFlect* project objective is to explore the information on sea surface wind contained in Aeolus surface return. This project considers the return signal from the so-called surface range bin. Before this return signal can be processed to arrive at a surface wind product, a diagnostic analysis of the return signal is performed to better understand the characteristics of this dataset. 

The analysis considers oligotrophic waters as these are radiometrically stable in space and time. Also the storm track regions in the southern indian and atlantic oceans are considered as in these regions strong winds are common.

Before we look at the data a few words on the process envisaged to support the activities, to better understand the presented diagnostic analysis.
