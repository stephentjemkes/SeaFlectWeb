# Diagnostic analysis of Aeolus return signal 

## Introduction

The *SeaFlect* project objective is to explore the information on sea surface wind contained in Aeolus surface return.
This signal originates from the so-called surface range bin, which is a composite range bin consisting of an atmosphere layer, the sea surface interface and an ocean layer.
Before a sea surface windspeed can be inferred from the return signal, a diagnostic analysis of the return signal is performed to better understand the characteristics of this signal. 

The analysis considers oligotrophic waters as these are radiometrically stable in space and time.

Also the storm track regions in the southern indian and atlantic oceans are considered as in these regions strong winds are common.

As a pre-amble a few words on the process envisaged to derive the windspeed from the return signal.
