# The SeaFlect Project


[The SeaFlect project](https://aeolus-surface-wind.aer.com/index.html) is an, under [ESA's EO Science for Society](https://eo4society.esa.int/) project funded activity aimed  to explore a possible relation between the Aeolus return signal from the ocean surface and the wind speed.

Such a relation has been demonstrated using the Aeolus Demonstrator (A2D),  but never using space borne observations.
As such it is a novel application of the Aeolus observations to widen Aeolus product portfolio.

The analysis of the A2D supports the following considerations: under low wind conditions the ocean surface is free of whitecaps, and the return signal is dominated by the backscatter from the sub-surface ocean layers, which in the cases considered here is chlorophyl. With increasing wind speed, whitecaps are formed on the sea surface. Whitecaps are bright in the UV. Thus a relation between fractional whitecap and surface return is expected. As he fractional whitecap is increasing with wind speed, also the surface return is expected to increase with windspeed. As such the expected relation is an indirect relation, namely through the fractional whitecap.

To arrive at an understanding if it is possible to derive a meaningful wind product from Aeolus surface return, first a diagnostic analysis of the basic Aeolus data is performed. Results of this analysis is presented here.
