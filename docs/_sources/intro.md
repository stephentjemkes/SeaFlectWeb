# Welcome to the SeaFlect Project

This is a small introduction to the SeaFlect project.
The SeaFlect project was initiated to explore possible relation between the Aeolus return signal from the ocean surface and the wind speed.
In theory a relation should exists: under low wind conditions the ocean surface is free of whitecaps, and the return signal is dominated by the backscatter from the sub-surface ocean layers. The fractional whitecaps increases with increasing wind speed. As whitecaps are bright in the UV, it can be expected that a larger white cap fraction would lead to an increased surface return signal.

These pages currently document the analysis of the main data, to arrive at an understanding if it is possible to derive a meaningful wind product from Aeolus surface return.
